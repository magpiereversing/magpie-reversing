Welcome to my blog, where I will be documenting a red teamer's exploration into the world of malware analysis and reverse engineering!

I will initially be adding my solutions as I work through the labs from [*Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software*](https://nostarch.com/malware). 
Given it has been some time since the book was originally published, I plan on using a mix of the tools detailed in the book and other modern alternatives that I've been exposed to. 

Shout out to Jai Minton, ~~whose idea I stole~~ whose blog posts on Practical Malware Analysis inspired the creation of this blog. If you have not already seen it, Jai's blog is a wealth of information: [*Jai Minton's Blog Site*](https://www.jaiminton.com/)
